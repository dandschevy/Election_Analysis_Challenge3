# Election_Analysis_Challenge3

## Overview/Purpose
The subject of Module 2 was creating macros in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA).  Throughout this module, and in separate steps and macros, VBA code was created to analyze two years of stock data, create an input box for the data year, create output data based on the year chosen, format the output data (including font, cell colors and number formatting), and create a message box with the processing time.  The purpose of the Module 2 Challege, was to take those separate macros and create one efficient macro that was more concise in design and took less time to process.  This was to be accomplished using "For Loops, "Nested For Loops", "If/Then" statements, "Nested If/Then" statements and indexing.  


## Results and Summary

### Results 


### Summary
With refactoring, there are advantages and disadvantages.  In general, the advantages are a more elegant and streamlined code, less macros to run, and time savings.  The disadvantages lie in the lack of clarity or transparency of the code and issues in the ability to review the code for errors.  Additionally, another disadvantage could be the inability to revise the code easily if it has been too refactored.

For the Module 2 Challenge, the advantages of the revised code were time savings and end-user efficiency.  The disadvantage of the new code is that it would be difficult for an inexperienced coder to create it without first having created each separate macro.
