# Election_Analysis_Challenge3

## Overview/Purpose
The subject of Module 3 was coding in Python using for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators.  In this module, Python code was used to analyze a csv file and audit a fictional election.  This included providing the total votes cast, the percentage and number of votes for each candidate, and the winning candidate, vote count, and percentage.  These election results were displayed on the terminal screen and printed to a separate text file.  The purpose of the Module 3 Challege was to add supplemental code in order to show the following additional:
    1.  The voter turnout for each county
    2.  The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
    3.  The county with the highest turnout
The output of the supplemental code above was also to be displayed on the terminal screen as well as added to the text file.
